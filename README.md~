# Toucan
Front End for IHop


### Development:
1. Download npm and node.js here: 
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

2. Clone the dev2 version of this repo onto your machine.

3. In the root of that directory, run the following commands:<br/>
`npm install`<br/>
`npm run dev`<br/>

4. Open https://localhost:3000 in your browser. 

### Info:
https://localhost:3000 is displayed from pages/index.js by default. We will be doing most of our work in the `/pages` and `/components` directories. `/pages` will be explicitly for standalone pages, such as the home page, members, login, and form building pages. The `/components` directory will be used to make the pieces we use inside of those pages.
